# Student Progress Tracker 📊

## Overview
The **Student Progress Tracker** is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) system designed to track and manage student performance. The tool allows staff and students to input credit values for **pass**, **defer**, and **fail** categories, categorizing the results into **Progress**, **Progress (module trailer)**, **Do not progress (module retriever)**, or **Exclude**. The system also includes a histogram to visualize the distribution of results and stores the outcomes in a text file for further review. 🎓📈

## Features ✨
- **CLI Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface for staff and students to input their credit values. 🖥️
- **Categorization:** Automatically categorizes student results based on the input credit values into four categories:
  - **Progress** ✅
  - **Progress (module trailer)** 🚀
  - **Do not progress (module retriever)** 🔄
  - **Exclude** ❌
- **Histogram:** Generates a histogram to visualize the distribution of outcomes. 📊
- **File Handling:** Stores the results in a text file for later review and analysis. 📝

## Usage 🖥️
1. Run the program using Python. ⚙️
2. Input the credit values for **pass**, **defer**, and **fail**. 💯
3. The program will categorize the results based on predefined criteria:
   - If the total credits sum to 120 and pass value equals 120 with no deferrals or failures, the result will be **Progress**. ✅
   - If the pass value is 100 with deferrals and no failures, the result will be **Progress (module trailer)**. 🚀
   - If the pass value is 80 or less with deferrals and failures, the result will be **Do not progress (module retriever)**. 🔄
   - If the pass value is 40 or less with fail value being above 80, the result will be **Exclude**. ❌
4. Results will be displayed, and the program will optionally generate a histogram to represent the outcomes. 📊
5. Results will be saved in a text file for further analysis. 📝
